# World War II

**World War II** or the **Second World War** (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a [global conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_war) between two coalitions: the [Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II) and the [Axis powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers). [Nearly all of the world's countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_by_country) participated, with many nations mobilising all resources in pursuit of [total war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_war). [Tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanks_in_World_War_II) and [aircraft played major roles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_warfare_of_World_War_II), enabling the [strategic bombing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_bombing) of cities and delivery of the [first and only nuclear weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki) ever used in war. World War II was the [deadliest conflict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll) in history, resulting in [70 to 85 million deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II_casualties), more than half of which were civilians. Millions died in [genocides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocides), including [the Holocaust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Holocaust), and by massacres, starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory, [Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Germany), [Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied-occupied_Austria), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_Japan), and [Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Korea#Post%E2%80%93World_War_II) were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were tried for [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime).

The [causes of World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_World_War_II) included unresolved tensions in the [aftermath of World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_I) and the rises of [fascism in Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism_in_Europe) and [militarism in Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_militarism). Key events preceding the war included [Japan's invasion of Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_invasion_of_Manchuria) in 1931, the [Spanish Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War), the outbreak of the [Second Sino-Japanese War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_War) in 1937, and Germany's [annexations of Austria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anschluss) and [the Sudetenland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Agreement). World War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when [Nazi Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany), under [Adolf Hitler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler), [invaded Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland), leading the [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_(1939)) and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_declaration_of_war_on_Germany_(1939)) to declare war on Germany. Poland was divided between Germany and the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union) under the [Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov%E2%80%93Ribbentrop_Pact). In 1940, the Soviets [annexed the Baltic states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupation_of_the_Baltic_states) and [parts of Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_War) and [Romania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_occupation_of_Bessarabia_and_Northern_Bukovina). After the [fall of France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_France) in June 1940, the war continued mainly between Germany and the [British Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire), with fighting in the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans_campaign_(World_War_II)), [Mediterranean, and Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_and_Middle_East_theatre_of_World_War_II), the aerial [Battle of Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Britain) and [the Blitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blitz), and naval [Battle of the Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Atlantic). Through campaigns and treaties, Germany gained control of much of [continental Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Europe) and [formed the Axis alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripartite_Pact) with [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascist_Italy_(1922%E2%80%931943)), [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan), and other countries. In June 1941, Germany led [an invasion of the Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa), opening the [Eastern Front](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)) and initially making large territorial gains.

In December 1941, Japan attacked American and British territories [in Asia and the Pacific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_War#Japanese_offensives,_1941%E2%80%9342), including at [Pearl Harbor in Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor), leading the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) to enter the war against Japan and Germany. Japan conquered much of coastal China and Southeast Asia, but its advances in the Pacific were halted in June 1942 at the [Battle of Midway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Midway). In late 1942, Axis forces were defeated [in North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_African_campaign) and [at Stalingrad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad) in the Soviet Union, and in 1943 their continued defeats on the Eastern Front, an [Allied invasion of Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allied_invasion_of_Italy), and Allied offensives in the Pacific forced them into retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [invaded France at Normandy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings) as the Soviet Union [recaptured its pre-war territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stalin%27s_ten_blows) and the U.S. crippled Japan's navy and [captured key Pacific islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrogging_(strategy)). The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of [German-occupied territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-occupied_Europe); [invasions of Germany by the Western Allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Allied_invasion_of_Germany) and the Soviet Union, which culminated in the [fall of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Berlin) to Soviet troops; and [Germany's unconditional surrender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Instrument_of_Surrender) on [8 May 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_in_Europe_Day). On 6 and 9 August, the U.S. [dropped atomic bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki) on [Hiroshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiroshima) and [Nagasaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagasaki) in Japan. Faced with an [imminent Allied invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Downfall), the prospect of further atomic bombings, and a Soviet [declaration of war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet%E2%80%93Japanese_War) and [invasion of Manchuria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_invasion_of_Manchuria), Japan announced [its unconditional surrender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan) on 15 August, and signed [a surrender document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_Instrument_of_Surrender) on [2 September 1945](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_over_Japan_Day).

World War II transformed the political, economic, social structures of the world, and established the foundation of international relations for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations) was created to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts, with the victorious [great powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power)—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the U.S.—becoming [the permanent members](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_members_of_the_United_Nations_Security_Council) of [its security council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council). The Soviet Union and U.S. emerged as rival global [superpowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower), setting the stage for the half-century [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War). In the wake of Europe's devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the [decolonisation of Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation_of_Africa) and [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonisation_of_Asia). Many countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [economic recovery and expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post%E2%80%93World_War_II_economic_expansion).
