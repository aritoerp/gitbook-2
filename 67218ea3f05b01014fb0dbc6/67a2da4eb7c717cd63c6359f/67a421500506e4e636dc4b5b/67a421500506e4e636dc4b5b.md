## Biography

### Season 1

Viktor was born in the [Undercity](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Zaun), where the less than ideal environment attributed to the development of his disability. Later on, in his teenage years, he was found by [Heimerdinger](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Heimerdinger), who offered Viktor the position of his assistant in [Piltover](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Piltover).

As a child, Viktor was excluded due to his disability. Born with a malformed leg and needing a cane to walk, his mobility issues inhibited him from playing with other children. Despite his loneliness, he was incredibly intelligent. He fostered an engineering talent, even creating a working model steamboat that he completes and tests within a flashback at the start of *[When These Walls Come Tumbling Down](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/When_These_Walls_Come_Tumbling_Down)*. In this episode, he meets [Sky Young](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Sky_Young) for the first time as a child, watching him as he tinkered with the boat.

After placing the boat in a stream to test-run it, the current of the water pulls it downstream faster than Viktor can keep up with. Demonstrating recklessness even as a child, Viktor chooses to follow the stream down into a dark, cave, where he finds it in the hands of [Singed](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Singed), a scientist who is attempting to preserve the life of a mutated [Waverider](https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Waverider) named [Rio](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Rio).

Praising Viktor for the quality of his invention, Singed allows Viktor to assist him in caring for Rio, feeding her what appears to be an early, raw variant of [Shimmer](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Shimmer).

After finding Rio in contorted in pain and hooked up to a series of machines, Viktor is horrified. Singed claims, "The mutation must survive," - but Viktor is unaccepting of his ethos and runs away.

How [Heimerdinger](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Cecil_B._Heimerdinger) discovers Viktor is unclear. Still, somewhere in his late teens, Heimerdinger encounters him and takes him under his wing, allowing him to study at the University of Piltover. Viktor goes on to become his assistant as Dean of the Academy.

While investigating on Heimerdinger's behalf, Viktor first meets [Jayce Talis](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Jayce_Talis), a fellow scientist whose illegal research is interrupted and exposed by [a robbery](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Welcome_to_the_Playground). Viktor risks stealing Jayce's notebook from Heimerdinger's office and seeks Jayce out to discuss its contents with him. After successfully talking a suicidal Jayce off the edge of his destroyed apartment, Viktor reassures Jayce that hope is not lost.

Jayce and Viktor begin working in what is presumably Viktor's office, discovering that the gemstones Jayce acquired can only operate under a much higher frequency. Jayce expresses a desire to explain his discovery to the council, to which Viktor retaliates they have an absence of proof. After realizing his equipment will be destroyed the following day, Jayce is devastated - leading Viktor to suggest breaking into Heimerdinger's lab to retrieve it.

Once they arrive at the lab, Viktor and Jayce are caught by [Mel Medarda](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Mel_Medarda), who, after being convinced by Jayce's speech, allows them one night to impress her by allowing them to stay, while she distracts an oncoming security guard.

Years later, [Hextech](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Hextech) blows up in popularity. Viktor lives in the shadow of Jayce, who is at the center of the public eye. Viktor had made a new creation called the [Hexcore](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Hexcore), which he venerably studies. One night as he studies the Hexcore, Viktor-already looking sickly-collapses at his desk. It is revealed that he is terminally ill, and his prognosis only spurs his drive to continue in his research, dedicating himself to discovering the workings of the arcane.

Heimerdinger visits him in the fissures, and Viktor tells the [yordle](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Species#Yordles) how he worried that knowledge of his contributions would fade away soon after his death.

In a bid to prolong his longevity, he seeks out the [doctor](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Singed), who gives him a vial of a [shimmer](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Shimmer) variant, which he takes in conjunction with exposure to [The Hexcore](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/The_Hexcore). His bad leg is healed, and he is able to walk for the first time.

Spurred on by [Mel Medarda's](https://arcane.fandom.com/wiki/Mel_Medarda) influence, Jayce considers using their technology to create weapons to defend Piltover, to which Viktor is vehemently opposed.

Later on Viktor reaches out to the Hexcore, which begins glowing and flashing wildly. Sky walks in on Viktor, and in a desperate attempt to save Viktor's life, pulls him away from the Hexcore. However, she is vaporized in the process, leaving Viktor with immense guilt.
