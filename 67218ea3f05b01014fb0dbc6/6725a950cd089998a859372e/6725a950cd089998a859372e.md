### Rugby union

On 20 March, [1892](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Rugby_Championship_1892) the USFSA organised the first ever French [rugby union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_union) championship, a one off game between [Racing Club de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_M%C3%A9tro_92) and [Stade Français](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_Fran%C3%A7ais). The game was refereed by [Pierre de Coubertin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_de_Coubertin) and saw Racing win 4–3.[6] Racing were awarded the [Bouclier de Brennus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouclier_de_Brennus), which is still awarded to the winners of the [French championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_14) today. The trophy was the idea of de Coubertin, who commissioned Charles Brennus, a member of the USFSA and a professional [engraver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engraver), to design it.[7]

### Football

In 1894 the USFSA also organised the first recognised [French football championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1894_USFSA_Football_Championship).[4] The first competition featured just four Paris teams and was organised on a knockout basis with [Standard Athletic Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Athletic_Club) beating White Rovers 2–0 after a replay. However, by 1896 it featured a league with nine teams and after 1899 the winners of a Paris League played off against the champions of other French regions and cities. In [1899](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1899_USFSA_Football_Championship) [Le Havre AC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Havre_AC) became the first club from outside Paris to be declared [French football champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_football_champions).[8]

In [1900](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_1900_Summer_Olympics) the USFSA sent players from [Parisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris) [Club Français](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Club_Fran%C3%A7ais) to represent [France at the 1900 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_at_the_1900_Summer_Olympics).[9][10] On 1 May 1904 the USFSA also selected the first official [France national football team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team). They held [Belgium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium_national_football_team) to a 3–3 draw in [Brussels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brussels)[11] In the same year, [Robert Guérin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Gu%C3%A9rin), secretary of the USFSA football committee, was also one of the principal movers behind the foundation of [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA). He also served as its first president.[2]

However the USFSA did not have a monopoly on organising [football in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_in_France). Between 1896 and 1907 the *Fédération des Sociétés Athlétiques Professionnelles de France* (FSAPF), who as their name suggests advocated [professionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sport), also organised a championship. Then in 1905 a rival organisation the *Fédération Gymnastique et Sportive des Patronages de France* (FGSPF), led by Charles Simon and [Henri Delaunay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Delaunay) and supported by the [Catholic Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholicism_in_France), also began organising competitions. In 1906 the *Fédération Cycliste et Amateur de France* (FCAF), a forerunner of the [Fédération Française de Cyclisme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration_Fran%C3%A7aise_de_Cyclisme) also began to organise a football championship. In 1907 the FGSPF and the FCAF, together with several regional organisations that also organised football formed the *Comité Français Interfédéral* (CFI). The CFI organised the *Trophée de France* which would challenge the USFSA equivalent, the *Coupe National*, as the recognised French championship.[4]

In 1907 the USFSA fell out with FIFA when the latter refused to admit the [(English) Amateur Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amateur_Football_Alliance). FIFA only recognised one national association per country, and so stood by the [(English) Football Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Football_Association), whereupon the USFSA left FIFA. They were replaced as France's representative by the CFI.[12] As a result, they also lost the right to select the [national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team).[13] USFSA along with the AFA and Bohemian [ČSF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Association_of_the_Czech_Republic) founded the [UIAFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UIAFA) in March 1909, and two years later, they organized the [1911 UIAFA European Football Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1911_UIAFA_European_Football_Tournament), where the USFSA team was knocked-out in the semifinals by the Bohemian team.[14] By 1913, however, the USFSA football committee had also become a CFI affiliate and in 1919 the CFI was reorganised as the [French Football Federation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Football_Federation). [1919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1919_USFSA_Football_Championship) was also the last year that the USFSA organized the *Coupe National* as a national football championship.

As a tribute to the USFSA, the members of the [France national football team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team) wore a reproduction of the kit worn in their first match in 1904 (displaying the USFSA emblem) during the FIFA Centennial celebration match against [Brazil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team) at [Stade de France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stade_de_France) in May 2004.[15]
